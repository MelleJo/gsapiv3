# Table Rendering Fix Notes

The issue with table rendering in the summary display was resolved through a combination of prompt engineering and frontend component logic:

1.  **Prompt Update:** The prompt for the 'Klantbezoek Tabelvorm' (`klantbezoek` ID in `PromptSelector.tsx`) was updated to explicitly instruct the AI to include the standard Markdown table separator line (`|---|---|...`) below the header row. This encourages the AI to generate valid Markdown table syntax.

2.  **Frontend Parsing Logic:** The `SummaryDisplay.tsx` component was modified to include custom parsing logic:
    *   It splits the incoming summary string by lines.
    *   It uses a helper function (`isPipeTableRow`) to identify lines that look like table rows (start/end with `|`, contain more `|`, and are not the separator line itself).
    *   It groups consecutive table rows together.
    *   It renders these identified table blocks using custom styled React components (`MyTable`, `MyThead`, `MyTbody`, `MyTr`, `MyTh`, `MyTd`) directly, bypassing the standard Markdown parser for these specific blocks.
    *   Other text content is rendered using the standard `markdown-to-jsx` parser.

This ensures that even if the AI occasionally fails to produce the perfect Markdown separator, the frontend can still recognize and render the pipe-delimited lines as a properly styled HTML table.
